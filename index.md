## Python Twitter Bot

One of my projects is a [Twitter bot](https://x.com/DonCheadleWOTDP) written in python that tweets an image with text every 24 hours using Python Anywhere.
The point of this project was to learn how to use the Twitter API and get more comfortable with the pillow library.

You can check out the code and more details on my [GitHub project page](https://github.com/ZacharyLong4003/Don-Cheadle-WOTD).
